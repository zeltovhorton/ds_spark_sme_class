    "Ipython notebook is a web-based interactive computing enviornment that is suitable for explorative analysis and data science, capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting, and executing code, as well as communicating the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The IPython notebook combines two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A web application:** a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their rich media output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook documents:** a representation of all content visible in the web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from V3.X IPython was renamed Jupyter to reflect the fact that although it started with supporting the Python programming language, it now fully support a variety of other progamming languages like Scala or R through a plug-in kernel mechanism."

In this way, notebook files can serve as a complete computational record of a session, interleaving executable code with explanatory text, mathematics, and rich representations of resulting objects. These documents are internally JSON files and are saved with the .ipynb extension. Since JSON is a plain text format, they can be version-controlled and shared with colleagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks may be exported to a range of static formats, including HTML (for example, for blog posts), reStructuredText, LaTeX, PDF, and slide shows, via the new nbconvert command.\n",

    "Furthermore, any .ipynb notebook document available from a public URL can be shared via the IPython Notebook Viewer (nbviewer). This service loads the notebook document from the URL and renders it as a static web page. The results may thus be shared with a colleague, or as a public blog post, without other users needing to install IPython themselves. In effect, nbviewer is simply nbconvert as a web service, so you can do your own static conversions with nbconvert, without relying on nbviewer.\n",
